Hi, I'm Duha ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Sudanese black female data science enthusiast
with a passion for uncovering insights through data and using it to make
impactful changes. I am continuously working to improve my technical skills
and dive deeper into the field, with aspirations to pursue a master's degree
in data science in the future.

I believe that everyone has a purpose in life, and mine is deeply tied to
giving back to my community and society. My dream is to contribute to the
rebuilding and re-innovation of my country, Sudan, and to support
its people as much as I can.

Beyond my professional ambitions, I love life and strive to live it to the fullest.
Swimming and dancing are my go-to activities for relaxation and stress relief.
Music and dance bring me joy and keep me grounded. I also enjoy trying new things,
my latest adventure has been kickboxing, which I absolutely loved!

Feel free to reach out to me to connect and learn from eachother.
